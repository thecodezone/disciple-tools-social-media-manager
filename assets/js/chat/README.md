This folder contains the code for the chat view. The chat view is the view that shows the chat messages for a conversation. The chat view is used in the modal dialogue that pops up when you click the "View Conversation" button in the conversation list view.

This code is currently mocked up and working but will likely change as we get information from the various APIs.
